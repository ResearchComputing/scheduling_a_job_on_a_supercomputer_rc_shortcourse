Getting started on a High Performance Computing cluster, such as Alpine, can be a daunting task for the uninitiated. Join us in this course where we will cover the basics of job scheduling.
Topics will include: a breakdown of Alpine’s hardware, submitting batch jobs, beginning interactive jobs, and submitting existing scripts to the cluster. You can expect to leave this training with a solid understanding of how to submit different types of jobs to Alpine.
In order to follow along with the hands-on component of this workshop, you’ll want to have a research computing account and a very basic understanding of Linux. For more information on obtaining a Research Computing account, you can read our Getting a CURC account documentation or watch a short video on Creating an Account. If you have questions or need assistance with creating an account, please email rc-help@colorado.edu or attend CRDDS Consult Hours.
